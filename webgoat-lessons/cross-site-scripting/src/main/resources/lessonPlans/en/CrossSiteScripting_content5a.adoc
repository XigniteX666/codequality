== Try It!   Reflected XSS

Identify which field is susceptible to XSS

It is always a good practice to validate all input on the server side. XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response.
In a reflected XSS attack, an attacker can craft a URL with the attack script and post it to another website, email it, or otherwise get a victim to click on it.

An easy way to find out if a field is vulnerable to an XSS attack is to use the _alert()_ or _console.log()_ methods. Use one of them to find out which field is vulnerable.
