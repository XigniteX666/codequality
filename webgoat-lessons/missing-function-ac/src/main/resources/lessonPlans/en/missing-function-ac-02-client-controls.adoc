== Relying on Obscurity

If you are relying on HTML, CSS or javascript to hide links that users don't normally access.
It's a little older, but there was a case of a network router trying to protect (hide) admin functions with javascript in the UI https://www.wired.com/2009/10/routers-still-vulnerable

=== Finding Hidden Items

There are usually hints to finding functionality the UI does not openly expose in ...

* HTML or javascript comments
* Commented out elements
* Items hidden via css controls/classes

=== Your Mission

Find two menu items not visible in menu below that are or would be of interest to an attacker/malicious user and put the labels for those menu items (there are no links right now in the menus).
