== Integrity

Integrity is "the property of accuracy and completeness." In other words, integrity means to maintain the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be changed during transit and it must be ensured, that data can not be altered by unauthorized people (per example in a breach of confidentiality).
